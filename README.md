## 🧩 About the Game

**THE COMPUTER** is an upcoming project surrounded by uncertainty, secrecy, and unanswered questions.  
At its core, the game is designed to slowly reveal itself over time rather than explaining everything upfront.

At this stage, only a few things are certain:

- The title of the project is **THE COMPUTER**
- The game is **actively in development**
- Information will be released **gradually**

Beyond that, details such as gameplay mechanics, story elements, setting, and genre remain undisclosed.  
This lack of clarity is part of the experience and vision behind the project.

## 🧠 Concept & Vision

The goal of **THE COMPUTER** is to create curiosity and tension before anything is fully understood.  
Players should question what they see, what they are told, and what might be hidden beneath the surface.

Nothing is meant to be taken at face value.

More about the concept, themes, and inspirations will be shared in the future.
